# Long-term Memory

**Long-term Memory** gives QwenPaw persistent memory across conversations. In the default backend, QwenPaw embeds the
ReMe application in-process and runs ReMe jobs to save conversation facts, build daily notes, extract digest memories,
watch resource files, and search the memory vault.

> The long-term memory mechanism is inspired by [OpenClaw](https://github.com/openclaw/openclaw) and implemented via **ReMeLight** from [ReMe](https://github.com/agentscope-ai/ReMe) — a file-based memory backend where memories are plain Markdown files that can be read, edited, and migrated directly.

## Memory File Structure

Memories are stored as plain files under the agent workspace. ReMe's Markdown files are the readable source of memory,
while `mem_metadata/` stores search indexes, catalogs, graphs, and embedding caches.

```
{workspace}/
├── memory/                         ← Daily memory notes
│   └── 2026-06-29/
│       ├── project-plan.md          ← One note written/updated by auto_memory
│       └── index.md                 ← Day index generated from the day's notes
│
├── mem_session/
│   └── dialog/
│       └── <session_id>.jsonl       ← Sanitized conversation history used as note source
│
├── digest/                         ← Auto-Dream digest memory and interest topics
├── resource/                       ← External assets watched by auto_resource
└── mem_metadata/                   ← ReMe persistent indexes and catalogs
```

### memory/YYYY-MM-DD/\*.md (Daily Notes)

Daily notes are the default Auto-Memory output. ReMe writes one or more notes per day, keyed by the source conversation
session. Each note includes frontmatter such as `session_id` and `source_conversation`, so later updates can find and
modify the existing note instead of creating duplicates.

- **Location**: `{working_dir}/memory/YYYY-MM-DD/*.md`
- **Purpose**: Stores durable conversation facts, decisions, preferences, and work notes
- **Updates**: ReMe `auto_memory` creates or edits notes using ReMe file jobs such as `daily_write`, `read`, `edit`,
  `frontmatter_update`, and `write`
- **Index**: After each successful write, ReMe refreshes the day's `index.md`

### mem_session/dialog/\*.jsonl (Conversation Source)

Before extracting memory, ReMe saves the relevant messages into a session log. Tool-result blocks and base64 data blocks
are stripped so recalled memory or large media cannot be mistaken for user-provided facts in future extraction runs.

- **Location**: `{working_dir}/mem_session/dialog/<session_id>.jsonl` by default
- **Purpose**: Source traceability for daily notes
- **Linking**: Daily-note frontmatter links back to the source conversation with `[[mem_session/dialog/<session_id>.jsonl]]`

### digest/ (Dream Memory)

Auto-Dream reads recent daily notes, extracts merged digest units, updates the dream catalog, and writes user-interest
topics for proactive use.

- **Location**: `{working_dir}/digest/`
- **Purpose**: Higher-level, cross-session memory and proactive-interest topics
- **Updates**: ReMe `auto_dream`, usually triggered by `dream_cron`

### resource/ (Resource Memory)

Files placed under `resource/` are watched and cataloged. When supported files change, ReMe can interpret them into
source-linked daily notes via `auto_resource`.

- **Location**: `{working_dir}/resource/`
- **Supported default suffixes**: `md`, `txt`, `json`, `jsonl`, `csv`, `yaml`, `html`
- **Date assignment**: Files directly under `resource/` are assigned to the current date. Files under
  `resource/YYYY-MM-DD/` use that date and may be nested in additional subdirectories.
- **Output**: Creates or updates `memory/YYYY-MM-DD/<note>.md` and retains a `source_resource` link in its frontmatter
- **Inbox behavior**: Resource processing results are pushed to the inbox only when memory changed

```text
resource/report.txt                    # Assigned to the current date
resource/2026-07-14/report.txt         # Assigned to 2026-07-14
resource/2026-07-14/project/data.json  # Subdirectories are allowed below the date
```

> Auto Resource currently reads resources as UTF-8 text. Binary files such as PDF, Word, Excel, and images are not in
> the watched-suffix list and are not parsed automatically; convert them to one of the supported text formats first.
> The `yml` suffix is also not in the default allowlist; use `yaml`.

## Searching Memory

The Agent has two ways to retrieve past memories:

| Method        | Tool            | Use Case                                                    | Example                                        |
| ------------- | --------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------- |
| Hybrid search | `memory_search` | Unsure which file contains the info; fuzzy recall by intent | "Previous discussion about deployment process" |
| Direct read   | File tools      | Known specific date or file path; precise lookup            | Read `memory/2026-06-29/project-plan.md`       |

### Hybrid Search Explained

`memory_search` calls ReMe's `search` job. Search always tries keyword retrieval through BM25 and also runs vector
retrieval when an embedding model is configured. When both paths return results, ReMe fuses the ranked lists with
**Reciprocal Rank Fusion (RRF)**.

#### Vector Semantic Search

Maps text into a high-dimensional vector space and measures semantic distance via cosine similarity, capturing content
with similar meaning but different wording:

| Query                                   | Recalled Memory                                           | Why It Matches                                                  |
| --------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------- |
| "Database choice for the project"       | "Finally decided to replace MySQL with PostgreSQL"        | Semantically related: both discuss database technology choices  |
| "How to reduce unnecessary rebuilds"    | "Configured incremental compilation to avoid full builds" | Semantic equivalence: reduce rebuilds ≈ incremental compilation |
| "Performance issue discussed last time" | "Optimized P99 latency from 800ms to 200ms"               | Semantic association: performance issue ≈ latency optimization  |

However, vector search is weaker on **precise, high-signal tokens**, as embedding models tend to capture overall
semantics rather than exact matches of individual tokens.

#### BM25 Keyword Search

Based on term frequency statistics for substring matching, excellent for precise token hits, but weaker on semantic
understanding (synonyms, paraphrasing).

| Query                      | BM25 Hits                                      | BM25 Misses                                           |
| -------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------- |
| `handleWebSocketReconnect` | Memory fragments containing that function name | "WebSocket disconnection reconnection handling logic" |
| `ECONNREFUSED`             | Log entries containing that error code         | "Database connection refused"                         |

ReMe maintains a local BM25 index over indexed files. This gives reliable hits for exact identifiers, error codes,
filenames, and uncommon words even when embeddings are unavailable.

#### Hybrid Search Fusion

When both vector and BM25 return candidates, ReMe uses weighted RRF. The default vector weight is `0.7`; the remaining
`0.3` goes to keyword search.

1. **Expand candidate pool**: Multiply the desired result count by `candidate_multiplier` (default 3×, capped at 200);
   each path retrieves more candidates independently
2. **Independent ranking**: Vector and BM25 each return ranked result lists
3. **RRF merging**: Deduplicate by chunk id and add rank-based contributions:
   - Vector contribution: `0.7 / (60 + vector_rank)`
   - Keyword contribution: `0.3 / (60 + keyword_rank)`
   - Chunks found by both paths receive both contributions
4. **Sort and truncate**: Sort by `final_score` descending, return top-N results
5. **Link expansion**: Search can include nearby linked files to provide additional context

**Example**: Query `"handleWebSocketReconnect disconnection reconnect"`

| Memory Fragment                                                               | Vector Rank | BM25 Rank | Why It Ranks Well                                   |
| ----------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ----------- | --------- | --------------------------------------------------- |
| "handleWebSocketReconnect function handles WebSocket disconnection reconnect" | 2           | 1         | Strong semantic match plus exact keyword hit        |
| "Logic for automatic retry after network disconnection"                       | 1           | -         | Strong semantic match even without exact identifier |
| "Fixed null pointer exception in handleWebSocketReconnect"                    | -           | 2         | Exact identifier hit keeps it in the candidate set  |

    Sort --> Results[Return top-N results]
```

> **Summary**: Using any single search method alone has blind spots. Hybrid search lets the two signals complement each
> other, delivering reliable recall whether you're asking in natural language or searching for exact terms.

## Backup & Restore

Backup & Restore is QwenPaw's backup and recovery capability, enabling safe saving and restoration of the entire agent environment for scenarios like version upgrades, cross-device migration, or undoing mistakes. Access: Console → Settings → Backup.

### Creating Backups

**Backup Storage**

All backups are saved as independent zip packages in `~/.qwenpaw/backups` (alongside the working directory `~/.qwenpaw`). Each backup contains `meta.json` metadata and packaged content files. The zip file is exported for easy migration. Note that backups do not include local model files; re-download is required for cross-device migration.

**Backup Scope**

- **Agent workspaces**: Selectable per Agent
- **Global settings**: `config.json` and other global configurations
- **Skill pool**: Shared skills directory
- **Secrets**: Model API Keys, environment variables, etc.

**Backup Modes**

- **Full backup**: One-click package of all the above content
- **Partial backup**: Backup selected modules and specific agent workspaces

### Restoring Backups

**Restore Modes**

- **Full restore**: Completely replaces the current instance with the backup — current content is deleted and replaced with backup content. Requires the backup to contain all modules (agent workspaces, global settings, skill pool, secrets).
- **Custom restore**: Restore by module or by Agent with fine-grained control. Local Agents not included in the restore scope remain unchanged.

**Pre-restore Prompt**

Before restoring, the system prompts to create a snapshot of the current state. If the restore goes wrong, you can roll back with one click.

**Notes**

- Backup files may contain sensitive credentials — store them safely and do not share with others
- Service restart is required after restore for new configuration to take effect

## Memory Configuration

### Configuration Structure

Memory configuration is located in `agent.json` under `running.reme_light_memory_config`:

| Field                           | Description                                                                    | Default          |

### Auto Memory Search Configuration

Configure in `running.reme_light_memory_config.auto_memory_search_config`:

When enabled, search results are injected into the current live context as a
completed `memory_search` interaction. They remain available to follow-up model
calls in the same tool loop until normal context management evicts them.

| Field         | Description                                              | Default |
| ------------- | -------------------------------------------------------- | ------- |
| `enabled`     | Whether to auto search memory on every conversation turn | `false` |
| `max_results` | Maximum results for auto memory search                   | `2`     |

### Embedding Configuration (Optional)

Embedding configuration for vector semantic search, located in `running.reme_light_memory_config.embedding_model_config`:

| Field              | Description                                                                                    | Default  |
| ------------------ | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | -------- |
| `backend`          | Embedding backend type: `openai`, `dashscope`, `dashscope_multimodal`, `gemini`, `ollama`      | `openai` |
| `api_key`          | API key for the embedding provider. Required for OpenAI-compatible and Gemini backends         | ``       |
| `base_url`         | Optional custom API URL for OpenAI-compatible backends. For Ollama, this is passed as the host | ``       |
| `model_name`       | Embedding model name                                                                           | ``       |
| `dimensions`       | Embedding vector dimensions                                                                    | `1024`   |

| `use_dimensions`   | Whether to pass dimensions parameter in API                                                    | `false`  |
| `max_cache_size`   | Maximum Embedding cache entries                                                                | `10000`  |
| `max_input_length` | Approximate character budget per Embedding request                                             | `8192`   |
| `max_batch_size`   | Maximum batch size for Embedding requests                                                      | `10`     |

> `use_dimensions` is for cases where some vLLM models don't support the dimensions parameter. Set to `false` to skip it.

Starting with ReMe 0.4.1.0, embedding input truncation uses a more conservative budget for token-dense CJK and other
full-width characters and reserves an additional safety margin. This prevents long Chinese memory entries from
exceeding the model context window and returning HTTP 400 with combinations such as Ollama and bge-m3.
`max_input_length` remains an approximate character budget rather than a strict token limit calculated by the model's
tokenizer. Reduce it further when using a model with a smaller context window.

Vector retrieval is enabled only when the selected backend has the minimum runnable configuration. These conditions are aligned with AgentScope credential requirements:

| Backend                                         | Enable condition                              | Credential mapping              |
| ----------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------- |
| `openai` / `dashscope` / `dashscope_multimodal` | Both `model_name` and `api_key` are non-empty | `api_key`; optional `base_url`  |
| `gemini`                                        | Both `model_name` and `api_key` are non-empty | `api_key`                       |
| `ollama`                                        | `model_name` is non-empty                     | optional `host` from `base_url` |

### Indexing Behavior

The embedded ReMe configuration uses a local file store with:

| Component        | Behavior                                                                                         |
| ---------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| File store       | Local ReMe file store under `mem_metadata/`                                                      |
| Keyword index    | BM25 keyword index enabled by default                                                            |
| Vector index     | Enabled only when `embedding_model_config` meets the enable condition for the selected `backend` |
| Watched dirs     | `daily_dir` and `digest_dir`                                                                     |
| Watched suffixes | `md`                                                                                             |

## Other Memory Backends

QwenPaw's memory system uses a pluggable backend architecture. In addition to the default ReMeLight (local file storage), you can switch to other backends via `memory_manager_backend`.

### ADBPG (AnalyticDB for PostgreSQL)

A long-term memory backend backed by a cloud vector database. It is suitable for scenarios that need cross-device sharing or large-scale semantic retrieval. QwenPaw connects through the ADBPG memory service REST API, so no additional database driver is required.

**Key features:**

- **Cross-session persistence** — Memories are stored in a cloud database, retained across restarts, and shareable across devices.
- **Server-side fact extraction** — Fact extraction is handled by the ADBPG memory service, with no extra client-side overhead.
- **REST API access** — Calls the ADBPG memory service over HTTP.
- **Graceful degradation** — When ADBPG is unreachable, the agent keeps running normally; only the long-term memory feature is temporarily disabled.

**How to configure:**

Open the agent's "Running Config" tab in the Console, locate the "Memory Manager Backend" dropdown, choose `adbpg`, and fill in `REST Base URL` and `REST API Key` under the "ADBPG Long-term Memory" tab.

![adbpg-backend](https://img.alicdn.com/imgextra/i3/O1CN01bH1Rj41wwQs3v04U6_!!6000000006372-2-tps-2954-1484.png)

> ⚠️ Switching the backend does not support hot reload. After saving, restart QwenPaw for the change to take effect (the page also shows a yellow banner reminder).

> Migration note: ADBPG direct SQL mode has been removed. Old fields such as
> `api_mode: "sql"`, `host`, `port`, `user`, `password`, `dbname`, and LLM /
> Embedding settings are ignored; configure `rest_base_url` and `rest_api_key`
> instead, then restart QwenPaw.

| `memory_isolation`          | Memory isolation mode: `true` for per-agent, `false` for shared                          | `true`                                |
| `search_timeout`            | Memory search timeout (seconds)                                                          | `10.0`                                |
| `auto_memory_search_config` | Auto memory search configuration; same shape as ReMe Light's `auto_memory_search_config` | `{"enabled": true, "max_results": 3}` |

**Configuration example:**

The full configuration can be written into `running.adbpg_memory_config` of `agent.json`:

```json
{
  "running": {
    "memory_manager_backend": "adbpg",
    "adbpg_memory_config": {
      "rest_base_url": "https://your-adbpg-memory-api.example.com",
      "rest_api_key": "your-rest-api-key",
      "memory_isolation": true,
      "search_timeout": 10.0,
      "auto_memory_search_config": {
        "enabled": true,
        "max_results": 3
      }
    }
  }
}
```

> 💡 When you fill these fields in the Console "Running Config" page, the framework writes them into `agent.json` automatically — no need to edit the file by hand.
