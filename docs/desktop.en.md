**Download**: [GitHub Releases][releases]

This guide explains how to install and use the CoPaw Desktop application on Windows and macOS.

[releases]: https://github.com/agentscope-ai/CoPaw/releases

## Important Notice

**The first launch may take a considerable amount of time (10-60 seconds or more, depending on your system configuration).** The application needs to initialize the Python environment, load dependencies, and start the web service. Please be patient while waiting for the window to appear. Subsequent launches will be faster.

**Q: How to uninstall?**
A: Go to Windows Settings → Apps → Installed apps → Find "CoPaw Desktop" → Uninstall

**Q: Is the installer safe?**
A:

- The application is **not Microsoft code-signed** (costs $200-800/year), so Windows Defender SmartScreen will show a warning
- This is normal behavior; click "More info" → "Run anyway" to proceed
- The code is completely open source, and the build process is transparently verifiable on GitHub Actions

## macOS Guide

### System Requirements

- **Operating System**: macOS 14 (Sonoma) or later
- **Architecture**:
  - ✅ **Apple Silicon (M1/M2/M3/M4)** - Recommended, supports MLX local model acceleration
  - ⚠️ Intel chips - May work, but cannot use MLX acceleration features

### Installation Steps

1. **Download the archive**
   Download `CoPaw-<version>-macOS.zip` from the [Release page][releases]

2. **Extract**
   Double-click the `.zip` file to extract and get `CoPaw.app`

3. **Move to Applications folder (Optional)**
   Drag `CoPaw.app` to the `/Applications` folder

### First Launch: Bypassing System Security Restrictions

#### Why manual trust is needed?

CoPaw is **not Apple Developer-signed or notarized**, so macOS Gatekeeper will block it by default.

**Why no signature?**

- 📋 Developer signing requires additional cost and procedures; will be added in future releases

**Current impact:**

- ✅ **No functional impact**: Application runs completely normally
- ⚠️ **First-time manual trust required**: One-time operation, permanently effective
- 🔒 **Security**: Open source code is auditable, transparent build process (CI/CD)

#### How to bypass restrictions?

#### Method 1: Right-click to open (Recommended)

1. **Right-click** (or Control + click) on `CoPaw.app`
2. Select **"Open"** from the menu
3. In the dialog that appears, click the **"Open"** button again
4. ✅ After this, you can double-click to launch normally without further prompts

#### Method 2: System Settings to bypass blocking

If still blocked:

1. Open **System Settings → Privacy & Security**
2. Scroll down to find a message like:
   _"'CoPaw' was blocked from use because it cannot verify the developer"_
3. Click the **"Open Anyway"** or **"Allow"** button
4. Enter your administrator password to confirm

#### Method 3: Terminal command to remove quarantine

```bash
# Remove download quarantine attribute
xattr -cr /Applications/CoPaw.app
```

⚠️ **Warning**: This method completely removes security checks; only use if you fully trust the application source.

### 🔍 Permission Requests

When first launched, macOS may request the following permissions:

- **Desktop file access permission**
  Used to access your files (if using file-related features)
  - Click **"Allow"** for normal use
  - Click **"Don't Allow"** and the app will still run, but some features may be limited

### Launch Options

#### Normal Launch (Double-click)

- Double-click `CoPaw.app` to launch
- The app runs in the background and opens a browser window
- Logs are written to: `~/.copaw/desktop.log`

#### Terminal Launch (View real-time logs)

If the app crashes or you need to see detailed logs:

```bash
# Navigate to the application directory
cd /Applications  # or wherever your CoPaw.app is located

# Set environment variables and launch
APP_ENV="$(pwd)/CoPaw.app/Contents/Resources/env"
PYTHONPATH= PYTHONHOME="$APP_ENV" "$APP_ENV/bin/python" -m copaw desktop
```

**Advantages of terminal launch:**

- ✅ View all log output in real-time
- ✅ See complete Python error stack traces
- ✅ Convenient for debugging and reporting issues
- ✅ Can add `--log-level debug` for more detailed information

**View log file:**

```bash
# View recent startup logs
tail -f ~/.copaw/desktop.log
```

### Common Issues

**Q: Nothing happens after double-clicking?**
A:

1. Check the `~/.copaw/desktop.log` file for errors
2. Use the terminal command above to launch and view real-time output

**Q: Message "Apple cannot verify this application"?**
A: Follow the "Bypassing System Security Restrictions" steps above

**Q: How to uninstall?**
A: Drag `CoPaw.app` to the Trash, then delete the `~/.copaw` configuration folder

**Q: Can I use it on Intel Mac?**
A: Yes, but you cannot use MLX model acceleration (MLX only supports Apple Silicon)

**Q: Why is the app not signed, and why does the system show a risk warning?**

A:

Currently using:

- ✅ **Open source transparency**: All code and build processes are public on GitHub
- ✅ **CI/CD verifiable**: GitHub Actions automated builds with viewable logs
- ✅ **User auditable**: You can review the code and build locally yourself
- ✅ **One-time trust**: Permanently effective after manual trust
