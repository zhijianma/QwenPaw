# Console

The **Console** is CoPaw's built-in web interface. After running `copaw app`,
open `http://127.0.0.1:8088/` in your browser to enter the Console.

**In the Console, you can:**

- Chat with CoPaw in real time
- Enable/disable messaging channels

The sidebar on the left groups features into **Chat**, **Control**, **Agent**,
and **Settings**. Click any item to switch pages. The sections below walk
through each feature in order.

## Cron Jobs

> Sidebar: **Control → Cron Jobs**

Create and manage scheduled jobs that CoPaw runs automatically by time.

![Cron Jobs](https://img.alicdn.com/imgextra/i3/O1CN01JET1Aw1C9SAvXuIpk_!!6000000000038-2-tps-3822-2070.png)

**Create a new job:**

> If the cron job fails to be created, please refer to the **Troubleshooting Scheduled (Cron) Tasks** section in the [FAQ](https://copaw.agentscope.io/docs/faq) to identify the cause.

The **simplest way to create a cron job is to chat directly with CoPaw** and let it handle the creation for you. For example, if you want to receive a reminder to drink water on DingTalk, simply message CoPaw on DingTalk: "Help me create a cron job to remind me to drink water every 5 minutes." Once created, you can view the new task on the Cron Jobs page in the console.

Alternatively, you can create tasks directly via the Console interface:

1. Click **+ Create Job**.

   ![Create Cron Job](https://img.alicdn.com/imgextra/i2/O1CN01jFAcIZ1wCAqyxDGKX_!!6000000006271-2-tps-3822-2070.png)

2. Fill in each section:
   - **Basic Info** — Job ID (e.g. `job-001`) and job name (e.g. "Daily Summary").
   - **Schedule** — Cron expression (e.g. `0 9 * * *` = 9:00 AM daily) and
     timezone (defaults to your configured user timezone)
   - **Task Type & Content** — **Text** (fixed message) or **Agent** (ask
     CoPaw and forward reply), then the content
   - **Delivery** — Target channel (Console, DingTalk, etc.), target user & session id, and
     mode (**Stream** = real-time, **Final** = one complete response)
   - **Advanced** — Max concurrency, timeout, misfire grace time
3. Click **Save**.

**Edit a job:**
Click **Edit** on a row → modify fields → **Save**.

**Enable/disable a job:**
Toggle the switch in the row.

**Run once immediately:**
Click **Execute Now** → confirm.

**Delete a job:**
Click **Delete** → confirm.

## Models

> Sidebar: **Settings → Models**

Configure LLM providers and choose the model CoPaw uses. CoPaw supports both
cloud providers (API key required) and local providers (no API key required).

![Models](https://img.alicdn.com/imgextra/i2/O1CN01Kd3lg91HdkS5SaLoF_!!6000000000781-2-tps-3822-2070.png)

### Cloud providers

**Configure a provider:**

1. Click **Settings** on a provider card (ModelScope, DashScope).
2. Enter your **API Key**.
3. Click **Save**. Card status becomes "Authorized".
4. To add a custom provider, click **Add Provider**.
5. Enter provider ID, display name, and required fields, then click **Create**.
6. Open **Settings** for the created provider, fill required fields, then
   **Save**. Status becomes "Authorized".

**Revoke authorization:**
Open the provider settings dialog and click **Revoke Authorization**. API key
data is cleared. If this provider is currently active, model selection is also
cleared.

### Local providers (llama.cpp / MLX)

Local providers show a purple **Local** tag. Install backend dependencies
first (`pip install 'copaw[llamacpp]'` or `pip install 'copaw[mlx]'`).

**Download a model:**

1. Click **Manage Models** on a local provider card.
2. Click **Download Model**, then fill:
   - **Repo ID** (required) — e.g. `Qwen/Qwen3-4B-GGUF`
   - **Filename** (optional) — leave empty for auto-selection
   - **Source** — Hugging Face (default) or ModelScope
3. Click **Download** and wait for completion.

**View and delete models:**
Downloaded models are listed with file size, source badge (**HF** / **MS**),
and delete button.

### Ollama provider

The Ollama provider integrates with your local Ollama daemon and dynamically
loads models from it.

**Prerequisites:**

- Install Ollama from [ollama.com](https://ollama.com)
- Install the Ollama SDK: `pip install 'copaw[ollama]'` (or re-run the installer with `--extras ollama`)

**Download a model:**

1. Click **Settings** on the Ollama provider card.
2. In **API Key**, enter a value (for example `ollama`), then click **Save**.
3. Click **Manage Models** on the Ollama card, click **Download Model**, and
   enter a model name (e.g. `mistral:7b`, `qwen3:8b`).
4. Click **Download Model** and wait for completion.

**Cancel a download:**
During download, click **✕** next to the progress indicator to cancel.

**View and delete models:**
Downloaded models are listed with size and delete button. The list updates
automatically when models are added/removed via Ollama CLI or Console.

**How it differs from local providers:**

- Models come from the Ollama daemon (not downloaded directly by CoPaw)
- Model list is auto-synced with Ollama
- Popular model examples: `mistral:7b`, `qwen3:8b`

> You can also manage Ollama models via CLI: `copaw models ollama-pull`,
> `copaw models ollama-list`, `copaw models ollama-remove`. See
> [CLI](./cli#ollama-models).

> ⚠️ **Before running CoPaw, you must set the context length to 32K or higher**
>
> To run CoPaw properly, you must set the model context length to
> **32K or higher**. Note that this can consume substantial compute resources,
> so make sure your local machine can handle it.
>

### LM Studio provider

The LM Studio provider connects to the LM Studio desktop application's
OpenAI-compatible local server to discover and use loaded models.

**Prerequisites:**

- Install LM Studio from [lmstudio.ai](https://lmstudio.ai)
- Load a model and start the local server in LM Studio (default: `http://localhost:1234`)

**Configure:**

1. Click **Settings** on the LM Studio provider card.
2. The default Base URL is `http://localhost:1234/v1`. Adjust if needed, then
   click **Save**.
3. Click **Manage Models** to see models loaded in LM Studio. You can also
   manually add model IDs.
4. Select **LM Studio** in the **Provider** dropdown and pick a model.

> LM Studio does not require an API key by default. Models must be loaded
> in LM Studio before they appear in CoPaw.

> ⚠️ **Before running CoPaw, you must set the context length to 32K or higher**
>
> To run CoPaw properly, you must set the model context length to
> **32K or higher**. Note that this can consume substantial compute resources,
> so make sure your local machine can handle it.

### Choose the active model

1. In the **LLM Config** section, select a **Provider** from the dropdown
   (only authorized providers or local providers with downloaded models appear).
2. Select a **Model** from the model dropdown.
3. Click **Save**.

> **Note:** Cloud API key validity is your responsibility. CoPaw does not
> verify key correctness.
>
> For provider details, see [Config — LLM Providers](./config#llm-providers).

## Environment Variables

> Sidebar: **Settings → Environment Variables**

Manage runtime environment variables needed by CoPaw tools and skills
(for example, `TAVILY_API_KEY`).

![Environments](https://img.alicdn.com/imgextra/i1/O1CN01jNMeBA1nMP9tQdTmU_!!6000000005075-2-tps-3822-2070.png)

**Add a variable:**

1. Click **+ Add Variable**.
2. Enter the variable name (e.g. `TAVILY_API_KEY`) and value.
3. Click **Save**.

**Edit a variable:**
Change the **Value** field, then click **Save**.
(Variable names are read-only after save; to rename, delete and recreate.)

**Delete a variable:**
Click the **🗑** icon on a row, then confirm if prompted.

**Batch delete:**
Select rows → click **Delete** in the toolbar → confirm.

> **Note:** Variable validity is your responsibility. CoPaw only stores and
> loads values.
>
> See [Config — Environment Variables](./config#environment-variables) for more.

## Token Usage

> Sidebar: **Settings → Token Usage**

View LLM token consumption over a time range, aggregated by date and model.

**View usage:**

1. Select a date range (default: last 30 days).
2. Click **Refresh** to fetch data.
3. The page shows total tokens, total calls, and breakdowns by model and date.

**Query via chat:**

Ask CoPaw directly, e.g. "How many tokens have I used recently?" or "Show me token usage." The agent will call the `get_token_usage` tool and return the summary.

> Data is stored in `~/.copaw/token_usage.json`. You can override the filename with the `COPAW_TOKEN_USAGE_FILE` environment variable. See [Config — Environment Variables](./config#environment-variables).
