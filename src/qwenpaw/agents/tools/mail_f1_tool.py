    """Activate F1 exploration mode. Call this when an email cannot be
    classified by the triage tree (MAIL_TRIAGE.md) and you need to
    attempt handling it with per-tool user approval.

    After activation, work in two phases: first ANALYZE the email from
    the recipient's (user's) perspective — its intent and how the user
    would handle it — and output a brief plan; then ACT step by step,
    stating a one-sentence reason before each tool call. The SYSTEM
    automatically intercepts every tool call (mail read/write, file
    ops, browser use, shell, etc.) and shows your reason and action to
    the user for approval, for the remainder of this request.

    IMPORTANT: Do NOT ask the user for approval yourself in your chat
    output. Just call the tools you need as usual; approval is handled
    automatically by the system. If the user approves, the tool returns
    its normal result; if the user denies, the tool returns a denial
    message and you should retry with a different approach.

    Returns:
        `ToolChunk`: Confirmation that F1 mode is now active.
